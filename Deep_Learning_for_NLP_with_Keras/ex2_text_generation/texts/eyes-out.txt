104: A RETIRED GENTLEMAN
105: 
106: _From Bishen Singh Saktawut, Subedar Major, 215th Indurgurh [Todd's]
107: Rajputs, now at Lyndhurst, Hampshire, England, this letter is sent to
108: Madhu Singh, Sawant, Risaldar Major [retired] 146th [Dublana] Horse, on
109: his fief which he holds under the Thakore Sahib of Pech at Bukani by
110: the River, near Chiturkaira, Kotah, Rajputana, written in the fifth
111: month of the year 1916, English count._
112: 
113: 
114: Having experienced five months of this war, I became infected with
115: fever and a strong coldness of the stomach [rupture]. The doctor
116: ordered me out of it altogether. They have also cut me with knives for
117: a wound on my leg. It is now healed but the strength is gone, and it is
118: very frightened of the ground. I have been in many hospitals for a long
119: time. At this present I am living in a hospital for Indian troops in a
120: forest-reservation called "New," which was established by a King's
121: order in ages past. There is no order for my return to India. I do not
122: desire it. My Regiment has now gone out of France--to Egypt, or Africa.
123: My officer Sahibs are for the most part dead or in hospitals. During a
124: railway journey when two people sit side by side for two hours one
125: feels the absence of the other when he alights. How great then was my
126: anguish at being severed from my Regiment after thirty-three years!
127: Now, however, I am finished. If I return to India I cannot drill the
128: new men between my two crutches. I should subsist in my village on my
129: wound-pension among old and young who have never seen war. Here I have
130: great consideration. Though I am useless they are patient with me.
131: 
132: Having knowledge of the English tongue, I am sometimes invited to

133: interpret between those in the hospital for the Indian troops and

134: visitors of high position. I advance eminent visitors, such as
135: relatives of Kings and Princes into the presence of the Colonel Doctor
136: Sahib. I enjoy a small room apart from the hospital wards. I have a
137: servant. The Colonel Doctor Sahib examines my body at certain times. I
138: am forbidden to stoop even for my crutches. They are instantly restored
139: to me by orderlies and my friends among the English. I come and go at
140: my pleasure where I will, and my presence is solicited by the
141: honourable.
142: 
143: You say I made a mistake to join the war at the end of my service? I
144: have endured five months of it. Come you out and endure two and a half.
145: You are three years younger than I. Why do you sit at home and drill
146: new men? Remember:
147: 
148:     The Brahman who steals,
149:     The widow who wears ornaments,
150:     The Rajput who avoids the battle,
151:     Are only fit for crows' meat.
152: 
153: You write me that this is a war for young men? The old are not entirely
154: useless. The Badshah [the King] himself gave me the medal for fetching
155: in my captain from out of the wires upon my back. That work caused me
156: the coldness in my stomach. Old men should not do coolie-work. Your
157: cavalry were useless in France. Infantry can fight in this war--not
158: cavalry. It is as impossible for us to get out of our trenches and
159: exterminate the enemy as it is for the enemy to attack us. Doubtless
160: the cavalry brigades will show what they are made of in Egypt or
161: Persia. This business in France is all Artillery work and mines. The
162: blowing up of the Chitoree Bastion when Arjoon went to Heaven waving
163: his sword, as the song says, would not be noticed in the noise of this
164: war.
165: 
166: The nature of the enemy is to go to earth and flood us with artillery
167: of large weight. When we were in the trenches it was a burden. When we
168: rested in the villages we found great ease. As to our food, it was like
169: a bunnia's marriage-feast. Everything given, nothing counted. Some of
170: us--especially among your cavalry--grew so fat that they were compelled
171: to wrestle to keep thin. This is because there was no marching.
172: 
173: The nature of the enemy is to commit shame upon women and children, and
174: to defile the shrines of his own faith with his own dung. It is done by
175: him as a drill. We believed till then they were some sort of caste
176: apart from the rest. We did not know they were outcaste. Now it is
177: established by the evidence of our senses. They attack on all fours
178: running like apes. They are specially careful for their faces. When
179: death is certain to them they offer gifts and repeat the number of
180: their children. They are very good single shots from cover.
181: 
182: It is the nature of the enemy to shower seductions from out of their
183: air-machines on our troops in the lines. They promised such as would
184: desert that they would become Rajahs among them. Some of the men went
185: over to see if this were true. No report came back. In this way we
186: cleaned out five bad characters from our Company exactly as it used to
187: be in the little wars on the Border. May the enemy be pleased with
188: them! No man of any caste disgraced our Regiment.
189: 
190: The nature of the enemy in this war is like the Nat [juggler] who is
191: compelled to climb a pole for his belly's sake. If he does not climb he
192: starves. If he stops he falls down. This is my thought concerning the
193: enemy.
194: 
195: Now that our troops have gone out of France, the war is entirely
196: between the enemy and the English, etc., etc. Both sides accordingly
197: increased the number and the size of their guns. The new wounded
198: officers in the English hospital say that the battles of even yesterday
199: are not to be compared with the battle of to-day. Tell this to those
200: who have returned and who boast. Only fools will desire more war when
201: this war is ended. Their reward will be an instant extinction on
202: account of the innumerable quantity of arms, munitions, etc., etc.,
203: which will be left in the hands of the experts. Those who make war
204: henceforward will be as small jackals fighting beneath the feet of
205: elephants. This Government has abundance of material, and fresh
206: strength is added every hour. Let there be no mistake. The foolish have
207: been greatly deceived in these matters by the nature of the English
208: which is in the highest degree deceptive. Everything is done and spoken
209: upside-down in this country of the English. He who has a thousand says:
210: "It is but a scant hundred." The possessor of palaces says: "It is a
211: hut," and the rest in proportion. Their boast is not to boast. Their
212: greatness is to make themselves very small. They draw a curtain in
213: front of all they do. It is as difficult to look upon the naked face of
214: their achievements as in our country upon the faces of women.
215: 
216: It is not true there is no caste in England. The mark of the high

217: castes, such as Ul or Baharun [Earl or Baron] is that they can perform
218: any office, such as handling the dead, wounds, blood, etc., without
219: loss of caste. The Maharanee of the Nurses in the English Hospital
220: which is near our Hospital is by caste Baharanee [Baroness]. I resort
221: thither daily for society and enlightenment on the habits of this

222: people. The high castes are forbidden to show curiosity, appetite, or
223: fear in public places. In this respect they resemble troops on parade.
224: Their male children are beaten from their ninth year to their
225: seventeenth year, by men with sticks. Their women are counted equal
226: with their men. It is reckoned as disgraceful for a Baharanee to show
227: fear when lights are extinguished in the hospital on account of
228: bomb-dropping air-ships, as for an Ul to avoid battle. They do not
229: blacken each other's faces by loud abuse, but by jests spoken in a
230: small voice.
231: 
232: The nature of the young men of high caste is as the nature of us
233: Rajputs. They do not use opium, but they delight in horses, and sport
234: and women, and are perpetually in debt to the moneylender. They shoot
235: partridge and they are forced to ride foxes because there are no wild
236: pig here. They know nothing of hawking or quail-fighting, but they
237: gamble up to the hilt on all occasions and bear losses laughing. Their
238: card-play is called Baraich [Bridge?]. They belittle their own and the
239: achievements of their friends, so long as that friend faces them. In
240: his absence they extol his deeds. They are of cheerful countenance.
241: When they jest, they respect honour. It is so also with their women.
242: The Nurses in the Hospital of my Baharanee where I resort for society
243: jest with me as daughters with a father. They say that they will be
244: stricken with grief if I return to India. They call me Dada which is
245: father also in their tongue. Though I am utterly useless they are

246: unwearied of me. They themselves hasten to restore me my crutches when
247: I let them fall. None of these women lament their dead openly. The
248: eldest son of my Baharanee at the English Hospital where I am made
249: welcome, was slain in battle. The next morning after the news my
250: Baharanee let loose the plate-pianos [turned on the gramophones] for
251: the delectation of the wounded. It comes into my mind to suggest to you
252: that our women are unable to stand by themselves.
253: 
254: When the Badshah commanded me to his Palace to receive the medal, I saw
255: all the wonders and entertainments of the city of London. There was
256: neither trouble nor expense. My Baharanee gave orders I should inhabit
257: her own house in that city. It was in reality a palace filled with
258: carpets, gilt furniture, marbles, mirrors, silks, velvets, carvings,
259: etc., etc. Hot water ran in silver pipes to my very bedside. The
260: perfumed baths were perpetually renewed. When it rained daily I walked
261: in a glass pavilion filled with scented flowers. I inhabited here ten
262: days. Though I was utterly useless they were unwearied of me. A
263: companion was found me. He was a Risaldar of Dekkani Horse, a man of
264: family, wounded in the arms. We two received our medals together. We
265: saw the King's Palace, and the custom of the Guard Mount in the
266: mornings daily. Their drill is like stone walls, but the nature of the
267: English music is without any meaning. We two saw the great temple, Seyn
268: Pol [St. Paul's?], where their dead are. It is as a country enclosed in
269: a house. My companion ascended to the very roof-top and saw all the
270: city. We are nothing beside these people. We two also saw the Bird
271: Garden [Zoological Gardens] where they studiously preserve all sorts of
272: wild animals, even down to jackals and green parrots. It is the nature
273: of the English to consider all created beings as equal. The Badshah
274: himself wears khaki. His son the Shahzada is a young man who inhabits
275: the trenches except when he is forbidden. He is a keen son of the

276: sword.
277: 
278: It is true that trains run underneath the city in all directions. We
279: descended into the earth upon a falling platform [lift] and travelled.
280: The stopping-places are as close as beads on a thread. The doors of the
281: carriages are guarded with gates that strike out sideways like cobras.
282: Each sitter is allowed a space upon a divan of yellow canework. When
283: the divans are full the surplus hang from the roof by leathers. Though
284: our carriage was full, place was made for us. At the end of our journey
285: the train was halted beyond its lawful time that we might come forth at
286: ease. The trains were full of English soldiers. All castes of the

287: English are now soldiers. They are become like us Rajputs--as many
288: people so many soldiers.
289: 
290: We two saw houses, shops, carriages, and crowds till our souls were
291: broken. The succeeding days were as the first, without intermission. We
292: begged at last to be excused from the sight of the multitudes and the
293: height of the houses.
294: 
295: We two agreed that understanding is most needful in this present age.
296: We in India must get education before all things. Hereafter we Rajputs
297: must seriously consider our arrangements in all respects--in our houses
298: as well as in our fields, etc., etc. Otherwise we become nothing. We
299: have been deceived by the nature of the English. They have not at any
300: time shown us anything of their possessions or their performances. We
301: are not even children beside them. They have dealt with us as though
302: they were themselves children talking _chotee boli_ [little talk]. In
303: this manner the ill-informed have been misled. Nothing is known in
304: India of the great strength of this people. Make that perfectly clear
305: to all fools. Why should we who serve the Government have the blood of
306: the misinformed on our heads when they behave foolishly? This people
307: have all the strength. There is no reason except the nature of the
308: English that anything in their dominions should stand up which has been
309: ordered to lie down. It is only their soft nature which saves evil from
310: destruction. As the saying is, "We thought it was only an armed
311: horseman. Behold, it is an elephant bearing a tower!"
312: 
313: It is in my mind that the glory of us Rajputs has become diminished
314: since the old days. In the old days, our Princesses charged in battle
315: beside their men, and the name of the clans was great. Then all Rajputs
316: were brothers and sisters. How has this come about? What man of us now
317: relies upon the advice of his womenkind in any matter outside? In this
318: country and in France the women understand perfectly what is needful in
319: the day of trial. They say to their men: "Add to the renown of your
320: race. We will attend to the rest through the excellent education which
321: this just Government has caused us to receive." Thus the men's hearts
322: are lightened when they go to the war. They confide securely in their
323: well educated women. How is it with our horses? Shape and size from the
324: sire: temper and virtue from the dam. If the mare endures thirst, the
325: colt can run without water. Man's nature also draws from the
326: spindle-side. Why have we allowed forgetfulness to impair our memory?
327: This was well known in the old days. In this country arrangements for
328: washing clothes exist in almost every house, such as tubs, boards, and
329: irons, and there is a machine to squeeze water out of the washed
330: clothes. They do not conceal their astonishment at our methods. Our
331: women should be taught. Only by knowledge is anything achieved.
332: Otherwise we are as children running about naked under the feet of
333: grown men and women.
334: 
335: See what our women have already accomplished by education! The Thakore
336: Sahib of Philawat was refused leave from the Government to go to the
337: war, on account of his youth. Yet his sister, who wedded the Rana of
338: Haliana had prepared a contingent of infantry out of her own
339: dower-villages. They were set down in the roll of the Princes'
340: contingents as stretcher-bearers: they being armed men out of the

341: desert. She sent a telegram to her brother, commissioning him to go
342: with them as Captain of stretcher-bearers: he being a son of the Sword
343: for seventy generations. Thus cleverly he received permission from the
344: Government to go. When they reached France he stole them out of the
345: camp, every one of his sister's men, and joined himself to the Rajah of
346: Kandesur's contingent. Those two boys together made their name bright
347: in the trenches. The Philawat boy was hit twice and came to hospital
348: here. The Government sent him a sealed letter by messenger where he
349: lay. He had great fear of it, because what he and Kandesur had done was
350: without orders. He expected a reprimand from the Government and also
351: from his uncle because of the succession. But the letter was an
352: announcement of decoration from the Shahzada himself, and when he had
353: read it, the child hid his face beneath the sheets and wept for joy. I
354: saw and heard this from my very bed in the hospital. So his Military
355: Cross and the rest was due to the Maharanee of Haliana, his sister.
356: Before her marriage she attended instruction in England at the great
357: school for maidens called Ghatun [Girton?]. She goes unveiled among
358: Englishmen, laying hold upon her husband's right arm in public
359: assemblies in open daylight. And Haliana is sunborn.[1] Consider it!
360: Consider it!
361: 
362:       [1] The royal clans of the Rajputs derive their descent from the
363:       Sun.
364: 
365: Do not be concerned if I do not return. I have seen all the reports of
366: all the arrangements made for burial, etc., etc., in this country. They
367: are entirely in accordance with our faith. My youth and old age have
368: been given to the service of the Government, and if the Government can
369: be served with the dust of my bones it is theirs, Now that my boy is
370: dead in Arabia I have also withdrawn my petition to the Government for
371: a land-grant. What use? The house is empty.
372: 
373:     Man does not remain in the world
374:     But his name remains.
375:     Though Jam and Suliman are gone
376:     Their names are not lost.
377: 
378: When that arrives, my Maharanee Baharanee will despatch to you
379: _posh-free par parshel-posh_ [post-free per parcel-post] my Cross that
380: the Badshah gave me, and a letter from my Captain Sahib's Mother with
381: whose brother I served when I was a man. As for my debts, it does not
382: trouble me in the least that the moneylenders should be so troubled
383: about them. But for the Army and the Police the people would have

384: killed all moneylenders. Give my duty to the Rana of Pech, for his line
385: were my father's overlords from the first. He can hang up my sword
386: beside my father's.
387: 
388: Do not be concerned for whatever overtakes me. I have sifted the sands
389: of France: now I sift those of England. Here I am held in the greatest
390: kindness and honour imaginable by all whom I meet. Though I am useless
391: as a child yet they are unwearied of me. The nurses in my Maharanee
392: Baharanee's Hospital, which is by day a home and a house to me,
393: minister to me as daughters to a father. They run after me and rebuke
394: me if I do not wear a certain coat when it rains daily. I am like a
395: dying tree in a garden of flowers.

400: THE FUMES OF THE HEART
401: 
402: 
403: _Scene._ Pavilion and Dome Hospital, Brighton--1915.
404: 
405: _What talk is this, Doctor Sahib? This Sahib says he will be my

406: letter-writer? Just as though he were a bazar letter-writer at home?...
407: What are the Sahib's charges? Two annas? Too much! I give one.... No.
408: No! Sahib. You shouldn't have come down so quickly. You've forgotten,
409: we Sikhs always bargain.... Well; one anna be it. I will give a bond to
410: pay it out of my wound-pension when I get home. Sit by the side of my
411: bed...._
412: 
413: _This is the trouble, Sahib. My brother who holds his land and works
414: mine, outside Amritsar City, is a fool. He is older than I. He has done
415: his service and got one wound out of it in what they used to call

416: war--that child's play in the Tirah years ago. He thinks himself a
417: soldier! But that is not his offence. He sends me postcards,
418: Sahib--scores of postcards--whining about the drouth or the taxes, or
419: the crops, or our servants' pilferings or some such trouble. He doesn't
420: know what trouble means. I want to tell him he is a fool.... What?
421: True! True! One can get money and land but never a new brother. But for
422: all that, he is a fool.... Is he a good farmer? Sa_-heeb! _If an
423: Amritsar Sikh isn't a good farmer, a hen doesn't know an egg.... Is he
424: honest? As my own pet yoke of bullocks. He is only a fool. My belly is
425: on fire now with knowledge I never had before, and I wish to impart it
426: to him--to the village elders--to all people. Yes, that is true, too.
427: If I keep calling him a fool, he will not gain any knowledge.... Let me
428: think it over on all sides! Aha! Now that I have a bazar-writer of my
429: own I will write a book--a very book of a letter to my fool of a
430: brother.... And now we will begin. Take down my words from my lips to
431: my foolish old farmer-brother:--_
432: 
433:                      *      *      *      *      *
434: 
435: "You will have received the notification of my wounds which I took in
436: Franceville. Now that I am better of my wounds, I have leisure to write
437: with a long hand. Here we have paper and ink at command. Thus it is
438: easy to let off the fumes of our hearts. Send me all the news of all
439: the crops and what is being done in our village. This poor parrot is
440: always thinking of Kashmir.
441: 
442: "As to my own concerns, the trench in which I sat was broken by a

443: _bomb-golee_ as large as our smallest grain-chest." [_He'll go off and
444: measure it at once!_] "It dropped out of the air. It burst, the ground
445: was opened and replaced upon seven of us. I and two others took wounds.
446: Sweetmeats are not distributed in war-time. God permitted my soul to
447: live, by means of the doctors' strong medicines. I have inhabited six
448: hospitals before I came here to England. This hospital is like a
449: temple. It is set in a garden beside the sea. We lie on iron cots

450: beneath a dome of gold and colours and glittering glass work, with
451: pillars." [_You know that's true, Sahib. We can see it--but d'you
452: think_ he'll _believe? Never! Never!_] "Our food is cooked for us
453: according to our creeds--Sikh, or Brahmin, or Mussulman and all the
454: rest--When a man dies he is also buried according to his creed. Though
455: he has been a groom or a sweeper, he is buried like some great
456: land-owner. Do not let such matters trouble you henceforth. Living or
457: dying, all is done in accordance with the ordinance of our faiths. Some
458: low-caste men, such as sweepers, counting upon the ignorance of the
459: doctors here make a claim to be of reputable caste in order that they
460: may get consideration. If a sweeper in this hospital says he is
461: forbidden by his caste to do certain things he is believed. He is not
462: beaten." [_Now, why is that, Sahib? They ought to be beaten for

463: pretending to have caste, and making a mock of the doctors._ I _should
464: slipper them publicly--but--I'm not the Government. We will go on._]
465: 
466: "The English do not despise any sort of work. They are of many castes,
467: but they are all one kind in this. On account of my wounds, I have not
468: yet gone abroad to see English fields or towns." [_It is true I have
469: been out twice in a motor-carriage, Sahib, but that goes too quickly
470: for a man to see shops, let alone faces. We will not tell him that. He
471: does not like motor-cars._] "The French in Franceville work continually
472: without rest. The French and the Phlahamahnds [Flamands] who are a
473: caste of French, are Kings among cultivators. As to cultivation--"
474: [_Now, I pray, Sahib, write quickly for I am as full of this matter as
475: a buffalo of water_] "their fields are larger than ours, without any
476: divisions, and they do not waste anything except the width of the

477: footpath. Their land descends securely from father to son upon payment
478: of tax to the Government, just as in civilized countries. I have
479: observed that they have their land always at their hearts and in their
480: mouths, just as in civilized countries. They do not grow more than one
481: crop a year, but this is recompensed to them because their fields do
482: not need irrigation. The rain in Franceville is always sure and
483: abundant and in excess. They grow all that we grow such as peas,
484: onions, garlic, spinach, beans, cabbages and wheat. They do not grow
485: small grains or millet, and their only spice is mustard. They do not
486: drink water, but the juice of apples which they squeeze into barrels
487: for that purpose. A full bottle is sold for two pice. They do not drink
488: milk but there is abundance of it. It is all cows' milk, of which they
489: make butter in a churn which is turned by a dog." [_Now, how shall we
490: make my brother believe that? Write it large._] "In Franceville, the
491: dogs are both courteous and industrious. They play with the cat, they
492: tend the sheep, they churn the butter, they draw a cart and guard it
493: too. When a regiment meets a flock, the dogs of their own wisdom order
494: the sheep to step to one side of the road. I have often seen this."
495: [_Not one word of this will he or anyone in the villages believe,
496: Sahib. What can you expect? They have never even seen Lahore City! We
497: will tell him what he can understand._] "Ploughs and carts are drawn by
498: horses. Oxen are not used for these purposes in these villages. The
499: field work is wholly done by old men and women and children, who can
500: all read and write. The young men are all at the war. The war comes
501: also to the people in the villages, but they do not regard the war
502: because they are cultivators. I have a friend among the French--an old
503: man in the village where the Regiment was established, who daily fills
504: in the holes made in his fields by the enemy's shells with dirt from a
505: long-handled spade. I begged him once to desist when we were together
506: on this work, but he said that idleness would cause him double work for
507: the day following. His grandchild, a very small maiden, grazed a cow
508: behind a wood where the shells fell, and was killed in that manner. Our
509: Regiment was told the news and they took an account of it, for she was
510: often among them, begging buttons from their uniforms. She was small
511: and full of laughter, and she had learned a little of our tongue."
512: [_Yes. That was a very great shame, Sahib. She was the child of us all.
513: We exacted a payment, but she was slain--slain like a calf for no

514: fault. A black shame!... We will write about other matters._]
515: 
516: "As to cultivation, there are no words for its excellence or for the
517: industry of the cultivators. They esteem manure most highly. They have
518: no need to burn cow-dung for fuel. There is abundance of charcoal.
519: Thus, not irrigating nor burning dung for fuel, their wealth increases
520: of itself. They build their houses from ancient times round about

521: mountainous dung-heaps, upon which they throw all things in season. It
522: is a possession from father to son, and increase comes forth. Owing to
523: the number of Army horses in certain places there arises very much
524: horse-dung. When it is excessive, the officers cause a little straw to
525: be lit near the heaps. The French and the Phlahamahnds seeing the

526: smoke, assemble with carts, crying:--'What waste is this?' The officers
527: reply:--'None will carry away this dung. Therefore, we burn it.' All
528: the cultivators then entreat for leave to carry it away in their carts,
529: be it only as much as two dogs can draw. By this device horse-lines are
530: cleaned.
531: 
532: "Listen to one little thing. The women and the girls cultivate as well
533: as the men in all respects." [_That is a true tale, Sahib. We know--but
534: my brother knows nothing except the road to market._] "They plough with
535: two and four horses as great as hills. The women of Franceville also
536: keep the accounts and the bills. They make one price for everything. No
537: second price is to be obtained by _any_ talking. They cannot be cheated
538: over the value of one grain. Yet of their own will they are generous
539: beyond belief. When we come back from our work in the trenches, they
540: arise at any hour and make us warm drinks of hot coffee and milk and
541: bread and butter. May God reward these ladies a thousand times for
542: their kindness!
543: 
544: "But do not throw everything upon God. I desire you will get me in
545: Amritsar City a carpet, at the shop of Davee Sahai and Chumba Mall--one
546: yard in width and one yard and a half in length, of good colour and
547: quality to the value of forty rupees. The shop must send it with _all_
548: charges paid, to the address which I have had written in English
549: character on the edge of this paper. She is the lady of the house in
550: which I was billeted in a village for three months. Though she was
551: advanced in years and belonged to a high family, yet in the whole of
552: those three months I never saw this old lady sit idle. Her three sons
553: had gone to the war. One had been killed; one was in hospital, and a
554: third, at that time, was in the trenches. She did not weep nor wail at
555: the death or the sickness but accepted the dispensation. During the
556: time I was in her house, she ministered to me to such an extent that I
557: cannot adequately describe her kindness. Of her own free-will she

558: washed my clothes, arranged my bed, and polished my boots daily for
559: three months. She washed down my bedroom daily with hot water, having
560: herself heated it. Each morning she prepared me a tray with bread,
561: butter, milk and coffee. When we had to leave that village that old
562: lady wept on my shoulder. It is strange that I had never seen her weep
563: for her dead son, but she wept for me. Moreover, at parting she would
564: have had me take a _fi-farang_ [five franc] note for expenses on the
565: road." [_What a woman! What a woman! I had never believed such women
566: existed in this Black Age._]
567: 
568: "If there be any doubt of the quality or the colour of the carpet, ask
569: for an audience of the Doctor Linley Sahib if he be still in Amritsar.
570: He knows carpets. Tell him all I have written concerning this old

571: lady--may God keep her and her remaining household!--and he will
572: advise. I do not know the Doctor Sahib, but this he will overlook in
573: war-time. If the carpet is even fifty rupees, I can securely pay out of
574: the monies which our lands owe me. She is an old lady. It must be soft
575: to her feet, and not inclined to slide upon the wooden floor. She is
576: well-born and educated." [_And now we will begin to enlighten him and
577: the elders!_]
578: 
579: "We must cause our children to be educated in the future. That is the
580: opinion of all the Regiment, for by education, even women accomplish
581: marvels, like the women of Franceville. Get the boys and girls taught
582: to read and write well. Here teaching is by Government order. The men
583: go to the war daily. It is the women who do all the work at home,

584: having been well taught in their childhood. We have only yoked one
585: buffalo to the plough up till now. It is now time to yoke up the
586: milch-buffaloes. Tell the village elders this and exercise influence."
587: [_Write that down strongly, Sahib. We who have seen Franceville_ all
588: _know it is true._]
589: 
590: "But as to cultivation. The methods in Franceville are good. All tools
591: are of iron. They do not break. A man keeps the tools he needs for his
592: work and his repairs in his house under his own hand. He has not to go
593: back to the village a mile away if anything breaks. We never thought,
594: as these people do, that all repairs to tools and ploughs can be done
595: on the very spot. All that is needed when a strap breaks, is that each
596: ploughman should have an awl and a leather-cutter to stitch the
597: leather. How is it with us in our country? If leather breaks, we
598: farmers say that leather is unclean, and we go back from the fields
599: into the village to the village cobbler that he may mend it. Unclean?
600: Do not we handle that same thing with the leather on it after it has
601: been repaired? Do we not even drink water all day with the very hand
602: that has sweated into the leather? Meantime, we have surely lost an
603: hour or two in coming and going from the fields." [_He will understand_
604: that. _He chatters like a monkey when the men waste time. But the
605: village cobbler will be very angry with me!_] "The people of
606: Franceville are astonished to learn that all our land is full of dogs
607: which do no work--not even to keep the cattle out of the tilled fields.
608: Among the French, both men and women and little children occupy
609: themselves with work at all times on the land. The children wear no
610: jewelry, but they are more beautiful than I can say. It is a country
611: where the women are not veiled. Their marriage is at their own choice,
612: and takes place between their twentieth and twenty-fifth year. They
613: seldom quarrel or shout out. They do not pilfer from each other. They
614: do not tell lies at all. When calamity overtakes them there is no

615: ceremonial of grief such as tearing the hair or the like. They swallow
616: it down and endure silently. Doubtless, this is the fruit of learning
617: in youth."
618: 
619: [_Now we will have a word for our Guru at home. He is a very holy man.
620: Write this carefully, Sahib._] "It is said that the French worship
621: idols. I have spoken of this with my old lady and her _guru_ [priest].
622: It is _not_ true in any way. There are certainly images in their
623: shrines and _deotas_ [local gods] to whom they present petitions as we
624: do in our home affairs, but the prayer of the heart goes to the God
625: Himself. I have been assured this by the old priests. All the young
626: priests are fighting in the war. The French men uncover the head but do
627: not take off the shoes at prayer. They do not speak of their religion
628: to strangers, and they do not go about to make converts. The old priest
629: in the village where I was billeted so long, said that all roads, at
630: such times as these, return to God." [_Our Guru at home says that
631: himself; so he cannot be surprised if there are others who think it._]
632: "The old priest gave me a little medal which he wished me to wear round
633: my neck. Such medals are reckoned holy among the French. He was a very
634: holy man and it averts the Evil Eye. The Women also carry holy beads to
635: help keep count of their prayers.
636: 
637: "Certain men of our Regiment divided among themselves as many as they
638: could pick up of the string of such beads that used to be carried by
639: the small maiden whom the shell slew. It was found forty yards distant
640: from the hands. It was that small maiden who begged us for our buttons
641: and had no fear. The Regiment made an account of it, reckoning one life
642: of the enemy for each bead. They deposited the beads as a pledge with
643: the regimental clerk. When a man of the guarantors became killed, the
644: number of his beads which remained unredeemed was added to the
645: obligation of the other guarantors, or they elected an inheritor of the
646: debt in his place." [_He will understand that. It was all very correct
647: and business-like, Sahib. Our Pathan Company arranged it._] "It was
648: seven weeks before all her beads were redeemed because the weather was
649: bad and our guns were strong and the enemy did not stir abroad after
650: dark. When all the account was cleared, the beads were taken out of
651: pawn and returned to her grandfather, with a certificate, and he wept.
652: 
653: "This war is not a war. It is a world-destroying battle. All that has
654: gone before this war in this world till now has been only boys throwing
655: coloured powder at each other. No man could conceive it! What do you or
656: the Mohmunds or anyone who has not been here know of war? When the
657: ignorant in future speak of war, I shall laugh, even though they be my
658: elder brethren. Consider what things are done here and for what
659: reasons.
660: 
661: "A little before I took my wounds, I was on duty near an officer who
662: worked in wire and wood and earth to make traps for the enemy. He had
663: acquired a tent of green cloth upon sticks, with a window of soft glass
664: that could not be broken. All coveted the tent. It was three paces long
665: and two wide. Among the covetous was an Officer of Artillery, in charge
666: of a gun that shook mountains. It gave out a shell of ten maunds or
667: more [eight hundred pounds]. But those who have never seen even a

668: rivulet cannot imagine the Indus. He offered many rupees to purchase
669: the tent. He would come at all hours increasing his offer. He
670: overwhelmed the owner with talk about it." [_I heard them often,
671: Sahib._] "At last, and I heard this also, that tent-owner said to that
672: Artillery Officer:--'I am wearied with your importunity. Destroy to-day
673: a certain house that I shall show you, and I will give you the tent for
674: a gift. Otherwise, have no more talk.' He showed him the roof of a
675: certain white house which stood back three _kos_ [six miles] in the
676: enemy country, a little underneath a hill with woods on each side.
677: Consider this, measuring three _kos_ in your mind along the Amritsar
678: Road. The Gunner Officer said:--'By God, I accept this bargain.' He
679: issued orders and estimated the distance. I saw him going back and
680: forth as swiftly as a lover. Then fire was delivered and at the fourth
681: discharge the watchers through their glasses saw the house spring high
682: and spread abroad and lie upon its face. It was as a tooth taken out by
683: a barber. Seeing this, the Gunner Officer sprang into the tent and
684: looked through the window and smiled because the tent was now his. But
685: the enemy did not understand the reasons. There was a great gunfire all
686: that night, as well as many enemy-regiments moving about. The prisoners
687: taken afterwards told us their commanders were disturbed at the fall of
688: the house, ascribing it to some great design on our part, so that their
689: men had no rest for a week. Yet it was all done for a little green
690: tent's sake!
691: 
692: "I tell you this that you may understand the meaning of things. This is
693: a world where the very hills are turned upside down, with the cities
694: upon them. He who comes alive out of this business will forever after
695: be as a giant. If anyone wishes to see it let him come here or remain
696: disappointed all his life."
697: 
698: [_We will finish with affection and sweet words. After all, a brother
699: is a brother._] "As for myself, why do you write to me so many
700: complaints? Are _you_ fighting in this war or I? You know the saying:
701: 'A soldier's life is for his family: his death is for his country: his
702: discomforts are for himself alone.' I joined to fight when I was young.
703: I have eaten the Government's salt till I am old. I am discharging my
704: obligation. When all is at an end, the memory of our parting will be
705: but a dream.
706: 
707: "I pray the Guru to bring together those who are separated.
708: 
709: "God alone is true. Everything else is but a shadow."
710: 
711: [_That is poetry. Oh--and add this, Sahib._]
712: 
713: "Let there be no delay about the carpet. She would not accept anything
714: else."
715: 
716: 
717: 
718: 
719: THE PRIVATE ACCOUNT
720: 
721: 
722: _Scene_: Three and a half miles across the Border--Kohat way. _Time_:
723: The edge of sunset. Single room in a stone built tower house reached by
724: a ladder from the ground. An Afghan woman, wrapped in a red cotton
725: quilt, squats on the floor trimming a small kerosene lamp. Her husband,
726: an elderly Afghan with a purple dyed beard, lies on a native cot,

727: covered by a striped blue and white cloth. He is wounded in the knee
728: and hip. A Government rifle leans against the cot. Their son, aged
729: twenty, kneels beside him, unfolding a letter. As the mother places the
730: lighted lamp in a recess in the wall, the son picks up the rifle and
731: pushes the half-opened door home with the butt. The wife passes her
732: husband a filled pipe of tobacco, blowing on the charcoal ball in the
733: bowl.
734: 
735: SON [_as he unfolds letter_]. It is from France. His Regiment is still
736: there.
737: 
738: FATHER. What does he say about the money?
739: 
740: SON [_reading_]. He says: "I am made easy by the news that you are now
741: receiving my pay-allotment regularly. You may depend upon its coming
742: every month henceforward. I have also sent eleven rupees over and above
743: the allotment. It is a gift towards the purchase of the machine needed
744: in your business."
745: 
746: FATHER [_drawing a cheap nickel-plated revolver from his breast_]. It
747: is a good machine, and he is a good son. What else.
748: 
749: SON. He says: "You tell me our enemies have killed my uncle and my
750: brother, beside wounding our father. I am very far away and can give no
751: help whatever. It is a matter for great regret. Our enemies are now two
752: lives to the good against us in the account. We must take our revenge
753: quickly. The responsibility, I suppose, is altogether on the head of my
754: youngest brother."
755: 
756: FATHER. But I am still good for sitting-shots.
757: 
758: MOTHER [_soothingly_]. Ah! But he means, to think over all the
759: arrangements. Wounded men cannot think clearly till the fever is out of
760: the wound.
761: 
762: SON [_reading_]. "My youngest brother said he would enlist after me
763: when the harvest was gathered. That is now out of the question. Tell
764: him he must attend to the work in hand." (That is true, I cannot enlist
765: now.) "Tell him not to wander about after the people who did the actual
766: killing. They will probably have taken refuge on the Government side of
767: the Border." (That is true, too. It is exactly what they did.) "Even up
768: the account from the nearest household of our enemies. This will force
769: the murderers for their honour's sake to return and attend to their
770: proper business when--God willing--they can be added as a bonus. Take
771: our revenge quickly."
772: 
773: FATHER [_stroking beard_]. This is all wisdom. I have a man for a son.
774: What else does he say, Akbar?
775: 
776: SON. He says: "I have a letter from Kohat telling me that a certain man
777: of a family that we know is coming out here with a draft in order to
778: settle with me for an account which he says I opened."
779: 
780: MOTHER [_quickly_]. Would that be Gul Shere Khan--about that Peshawari
781: girl?
782: 
783: SON. Perhaps. But Ahmed is not afraid. Listen! He says: "If that man or
784: even his brothers wish to come to France after me I shall be very

785: pleased. If, in fact, anyone wishes to kill me, let them by all means
786: come out. I am here present in the field of battle. I have placed my
787: life on a tray. The people in our country who talk about killing are
788: children. They have not seen the reality of things. _We_ do not turn
789: our heads when forty are killed at a breath. Men are swallowed up or
790: blown apart here as one divides meat. When we are in the trenches,
791: there is no time to strike a blow on the private account. When we are
792: at rest in the villages, one's lust for killing has been satisfied. Two
793: men joined us in the draft last month to look after a close friend of
794: mine with whom they had a private account. They were great
795: swash-bucklers at first. They even volunteered to go into the trenches
796: though it was not their turn of duty. They expected that their private
797: account could be settled during some battle. Since that turn of duty
798: they have become quite meek. They had, till then, only seen men killed
799: by ones and twos, half a mile separating them. _This_ business was like
800: killing flies on sugar. Have no fear for me, therefore, no matter who
801: joins the Regiment. It needs a very fierce stomach to add anything to
802: our Government rations."
803: 
804: MOTHER. He writes like a poet, my son. That is wonderful writing.

805: 
806: FATHER. All the young men write the same with regard to the war. It
807: _quite_ satisfies all desires. What else does he say?
808: 
809: SON [_summarizing_]. He says that he is well fed and has learned to
810: drink the French coffee. He says there are two sorts of French
811: tobacco--one yellow, one blue. The blue, he says, is the best. They are
812: named for the papers they are wrapped in. He says that on no account
813: must we send him any opium or drugs, because the punishment for
814: drugging is severe and the doctors are quick to discover. He desires to
815: be sent to him some strong hair-dye of the sort that our father uses.
816: 
817: MOTHER [_with a gesture_]. Hair-dye! He is a child. What's he been
818: doing?
819: 
820: SON. He says he wishes to win favour from his native officer whose
821: white hairs are showing and who has no proper dye. He says he will
822: repay the cost and that no charges are made for the parcel. It must be
823: very strong henna-dye.
824: 
825: MOTHER [_laughing_]. It shall be. I will make it myself. A start it
826: gave me to hear _him_ ask for dyes! They are not due for another twenty
827: years.
828: 
829: FATHER [_fretfully_]. Read it. Read it all as it is written, word for
830: word. What else does he say?
831: 
832: SON. He speaks of the country of the French. Listen! He says: "This
833: country is full of precious objects, such as grain, ploughs, and
834: implements, and sheep which lie about the fields by day with none to
835: guard them. The French are a virtuous people and do not steal from each
836: other. If a man merely approaches towards anything there are eyes

837: watching him. To take one chicken is to loosen the tongues of fifty old
838: women. I was warned on joining that the testimony of one such would
839: outweigh the testimony of six honourable Pathans. It is true. Money and
840: valuables are, therefore, left openly in houses. None dare even to look
841: at them with a covetous eye. I have seen two hundred rupees' worth of
842: clothing hung up on a nail. None knew the owner, yet it remained till
843: her return."
844: 
845: MOTHER. That is the country for me! Dresses worth two hundred rupees
846: hanging on nails! Princesses all they must be.
847: 
848: SON [_continuing_]. Listen to these fresh marvels. He says: "We reside
849: in brick houses with painted walls of flowers and birds; we sit upon
850: chairs covered with silks. We sleep on high beds that cost a hundred
851: rupees each. There is glass in all the doors and windows; the abundance
852: of iron and brass, pottery, and copper kitchen-utensils is not to be
853: estimated. Every house is a palace of entertainment filled with clocks,
854: lamps, candlesticks, gildings, and images."
855: 
856: FATHER. What a country! What a country! How much will he be able to
857: bring back of it all?
858: 
859: SON. He says: "The inhabitants defend their possessions to the
860: uttermost--even down to the value of half a chicken or a sheep's
861: kidney. They do not keep their money in their houses, but send it away
862: on loan. Their rates of interest are very low. They talk among
863: themselves of loans and pledges and the gaining of money, just as we
864: do. We Indian troops are esteemed and honoured by all, by the children
865: specially. These children wear no jewelry. Therefore, there are no
866: murders committed for the sake of ornaments except by the enemy. These
867: children resemble small moons. They make mud figures in their play of
868: men and horses. He who can add figures of oxen, elephants and
869: palanquins is highly praised. Do you remember when I used to make

870: them?"
871: 
872: MOTHER. Do I remember? Am I a block of wood or an old churn? Go on,
873: Akbar? What of my child?
874: 
875: SON. He says: "When the children are not in the school they are at work
876: in the fields from their earliest years. They soon lose all fear of us
877: soldiers, and drill us up and down the streets of the villages. The
878: smallest salute on all occasions. They suffer little from sickness. The
879: old women here are skilful in medicines. They dry the leaves of trees
880: and give them for a drink against diseases. One old woman gave me an
881: herb to chew for a worm in my tooth [toothache] which cured me in an
882: hour."
883: 
884: MOTHER. God reward that woman! I wonder what she used.
885: 
886: SON. He says: "She is my French mother."
887: 
888: MOTHER. What-t! How many mothers has a man? But God reward her none the
889: less! It must have been that old double-tooth at the back on the left
890: lower side, for I remember----
891: 
892: FATHER. Let it wait. It is cured now. What else does he write?
893: 
894: SON. He writes, making excuses for not having written. He says: "I have
895: been so occupied and sent from one place to another that on several
896: occasions I have missed the post. I know you must have experienced
897: anxiety. But do not be displeased. Let my mother remember that I can
898: only write when I have opportunity, and the only remedy for
899: helplessness is patience."
900: 
901: FATHER [_groaning_]. Ah! He has not yet been wounded, and he sets
902: himself up for a physician.
903: 
904: MOTHER. He speaks wisely and beautifully. But what of his "French

905: mother"--burn her!
906: 
907: SON. He says: "Moreover, this French mother of mine in France is
908: displeased with me if I do not write to her about my welfare. My
909: mother, like you, my French mother does all she can for my welfare. I
910: cannot write sufficiently in praise of what she does for me. When I was
911: in the village behind the trench if, on any day, by reason of duty, I
912: did not return till evening, she, herself, would come in search of me
913: and lead me back to the house.
914: 
915: MOTHER. Aha! _She_ knew! I wish I could have caught him by the other
916: ear!
917: 
918: SON. He says: "And when I was sent away on duty to another village, and
919: so could not find time to write either to you or to her, she came close
920: to the place where I was and where no one is permitted to come and
921: asked to see her boy. She brought with her a great parcel of things for
922: me to eat. What more am I to say for the concern she has for my
923: welfare?"
924: 
925: MOTHER. Fools all old women are! May God reward that Kafir woman for
926: her kindness, and her children after her.... As though any orders could
927: keep out a mother! Does he say what she resembles in the face?
928: 
929: SON. No. He goes on to speak more about the customs of the French. He
930: says: "The new men who join us come believing they are in the country
931: of the Rakshas [Demons]. They are told this by the ignorant on their
932: departure. It is always cold here. Many clothes are worn. The sun is
933: absent. The wet is present. Yet this France is a country created by
934: Allah, and its people are manifestly a reasonable people with reason
935: for all they do. The windows of their houses are well barred. The doors
936: are strong, with locks of a sort I have never before tried. Their dogs
937: are faithful. They gather in and keep their kine and their asses and
938: their hens under their hands at night. Their cattle graze and return at
939: the proper hour in charge of the children. They prune their fruit trees
940: as carefully as our barbers attend to men's nostrils and ears. The old
941: women spin, walking up and down. Scissors, needles, threads, and
942: buttons are exposed for sale on stalls in a market. They carry hens by
943: the feet. Butchers sell dressed portions of fowls and sheep ready to be
944: cooked. There is aniseed, coriander, and very good garlic."
945: 
946: MOTHER. But all this--but all this is our very own way----
947: 
948: SON. He says so. He says: "Seeing these things, the new men are
949: relieved in their minds. Do not be anxious for me. These people
950: precisely resemble all mankind. They are, however, idolators. They do
951: not speak to any of us about their religion. Their Imams [priests] are
952: old men of pious appearance, living in poverty. They go about their
953: religious offices, even while the shells fall. Their God is called
954: Bandoo [Bon Dieu?]. There is also the Bibbee Miriam [the Virgin Mary].
955: She is worshipped on account of the intelligence and capacity of the
956: women."
957: 
958: FATHER. Hmm! Ah! This travelling about is bad for the young. Women are
959: women--world over. What else, Akbar?
960: 
961: SON [_reading_]. "There are holy women in this country, dressed in
962: black who wear horns of white cloth on their heads. They too, are

963: without any sort of fear of death from the falling shells. I am
964: acquainted with one such who often commands me to carry vegetables from
965: the market to the house which they inhabit. It is filled with the

966: fatherless. She is very old, very highborn, and of irascible temper.
967: All men call her Mother. The Colonel himself salutes her. Thus are all
968: sorts mingled in this country of France."
969: 
970: MOTHER. Ha! Well, at least that holy woman was well-born, but she is
971: too free with her tongue. Go on!
972: 
973: SON. He says: "Through my skill with my rifle, I have been made a

974: sharp-shooter. A special place is given to me to shoot at the enemy
975: singly. This was old work to me. This country was flat and open at the
976: beginning. In time it became all _kandari-kauderi_--cut up--with
977: trenches, _sungars_ and bye-ways in the earth. Their faces show well
978: behind the loop-holes of their _sungars_. The distance was less than
979: three hundred yards. Great cunning was needed. Before they grew
980: careful, I accounted for nine in five days. It is more difficult by
981: night. They then send up fireballs which light all the ground. This is
982: a good arrangement to reveal one's enemy, but the expense would be too
983: great for poor people."
984: 
985: FATHER. He thinks of everything--everything! Even of the terrible cost
986: for us poor people.
987: 
988: SON [_reading_]. "I attended the funeral of a certain French child. She
989: was known to us all by the name of 'Marri' which is Miriam. She would
990: openly claim the Regiment for her own regiment in the face of the

991: Colonel walking in the street. She was slain by a shell while grazing
992: cattle. What remained was carried upon a litter precisely after our
993: custom. There were no hired mourners. All mourners walked slowly behind
994: the litter, the women with the men. It is not their custom to scream or
995: beat the breast. They recite all prayers above the grave itself for
996: they reckon the burial-ground to be holy. The prayers are recited by
997: the Imam of the village. The grave is not bricked and there is no

998: recess. They do not know that the Two Angels visit the dead. They say
999: at the end, 'Peace and Mercy be on you'."
1000: 
1001: MOTHER. One sees as he writes! He would have made a great priest, this
1002: son of ours. So they pray over their dead, out yonder, those
1003: foreigners?
1004: 
1005: FATHER. Even a Kafir may pray, but--they are manifestly Kafirs or they
1006: would not pray in a grave-yard. Go on!
1007: 
1008: SON. "When their prayers were done, our Havildar-Major, who is
1009: orthodox, recited the appropriate verse from the Koran, and cast a
1010: little mud into the grave. The Imam of the village then embraced him. I
1011: do not know if this is the custom. The French weep very little. The
1012: French women are small-handed and small-footed. They bear themselves in
1013: walking as though they were of birth and descent. They commune with
1014: themselves, walking up and down. Their lips move. This is on account of
1015: their dead. They are never abashed or at a loss for words. They forget
1016: nothing. Nothing either do they forgive."
1017: 
1018: MOTHER. Good. Very good. That is the right honour.
1019: 
1020: SON. Listen! He says: "Each village keeps a written account of all that
1021: the enemy has done against it. If a life--a life, whether it be man or
1022: priest, or hostage, or woman or babe. Every horn driven off; and every
1023: feather; all bricks and tiles broken, all things burned, and their
1024: price, are written in the account. The shames and the insults are also
1025: written. There is no price set against them."
1026: 
1027: FATHER. This is without flaw! This is a people! There is never any
1028: price for shame offered. And they write it all down. Marvellous!

1029: 
1030: SON. Yes. He says: "Each village keeps its own tally and all tallies go
1031: to their Government to be filed. The whole of the country of France is
1032: in one great account against the enemy--for the loss, for the lives,
1033: and for the shames done. It has been kept from the first. The women
1034: keep it with the men. All French women read, write, and cast accounts
1035: from youth. By this they are able to keep the great account against the
1036: enemy. I think that it is good that our girls should get schooling like
1037: this. Then we shall have no more confusion in our accounts. It is only
1038: to add up the sums lost and the lives. We should teach our girls. We
1039: are fools compared with these people."
1040: 
1041: MOTHER. But a Pathani girl remembers without all this book-work. It is
1042: waste. Who of any decent descent ever forgot a blood-debt? He must be
1043: sickening for illness to write thus.
1044: 
1045: FATHER. One should not forget. Yet we depend on songs and tales. It is
1046: more secure--certainly, it is more business-like--that a written

1047: account should be kept. Since it is the men who must pay off the debt,
1048: why should not the women keep it?
1049: 
1050: MOTHER. They can keep tally on a stick or a distaff. It is unnecessary
1051: for a girl to scribble in books. They never come to good ends. They end
1052: by----
1053: 
1054: SON. Sometimes, my mother, sometimes. On the Government side of the
1055: Border, women are taught to read, and write, and cast accounts, and----
1056: 
1057: MOTHER [_with intention_]. Far be the day when such an one is brought
1058: to _my_ house as a bride. For _I_ say----
1059: 
1060: FATHER. No matter. What does _he_ say about those French women?
1061: 
1062: SON. He says: "They are not divided in opinion as to which of their
1063: enemies shall be sought after first. They say: 'Let us even the account
1064: every day and night out of the nearest assembly of the enemy and when
1065: we have brought all the enemy into the right way of thinking we can
1066: demand the very people who did the shame and offences. In the meantime,
1067: let it be any life.' This is good counsel for _us_ in our account, oh
1068: my mother."
1069: 
1070: FATHER [_after a pause_]. True! True! It is good advice. Let it be any
1071: life.... Is that all?
1072: 
1073: SON. That is all. He says: "Let it be _any_ life." And I think so too.
1074: 
1075: MOTHER. "_Any_ life." Even so! And then we can write to him quickly
1076: that we have taken our revenge quickly. [_She reaches for her husband's
1077: rifle which she passes over to her son, who stretches his hand towards
1078: it with a glance at his father._]
1079: 
1080: FATHER. On your head, Akbar, our account must lie--at least till I am
1081: better. Do you try to-night?
1082: 
1083: SON. May be! I wish we had the high-priced illuminating fireballs he
1084: spoke of. [_Half rises._]
1085: 
1086: MOTHER. Wait a little. There is the call for the Ishr [the evening
1087: prayer].
1088: 
1089: MUEZZIN [_in the village mosque without as the first stars show_]. God
1090: is great! God is great! God is great! I bear witness, etc.
1091: 
1092: [_The family compose themselves for evening prayer._]
1093: 
1094: 
1095: 
1096: 
1097: A TROOPER OF HORSE
1098: 
1099: _To the sister of the pensioned Risaldar Major Abdul Qadr Khan, at her
1100: own house behind the shrine of Gulu Shah near by the village of Korake
1101: in the Pasrur Tehsil of the Sialkot District in the Province of the
1102: Punjab. Sent out of the country of France on the 23rd of August, 1916,
1103: by Duffadar Abdul Rahman of the 132nd (Pakpattan) Cavalry--late
1104: Lambart's Horse._
1105: 
1106: 
1107: Mother! The news is that once only in five months I have not received a
1108: letter from you. My thoughts are always with you. Mother, put your ear
1109: down and listen to me. Do not fret; I will soon be with you again.
1110: Imagine that I have merely gone to Lyallpur [the big recruiting-dépôt
1111: in India]; think that I have been delayed there by an officer's order,
1112: or that I am not yet ready to come back. Mother, think of me always as
1113: though I were sitting near by, just as I imagine you always beside me.
1114: Be of good cheer, Mother, there is nothing that I have done which is
1115: hidden from you. I tell you truly, Mother, I will salute you again. Do
1116: not grieve. I tell you confidently I shall bow before you again in
1117: salutation. It will be thus, Mother. I shall come in the dead of the
1118: night and knock at your door. Then I will call loudly that you may wake
1119: and open the door to me. With great delight you will open the door and
1120: fold me to your breast, my Mother. Then I will sit down beside you and
1121: tell you what has happened to me--good and evil. Then having rested the
1122: night in comfort I will go out after the day has come and I will salute
1123: all my brethren at the mosque and in the village. Then I will return
1124: and eat my bread in pleasure and happiness. You, Mother, will say to
1125: me: "Shall I give you some _ghi_?" [native butter]. I will say at first
1126: proudly, like one who has travelled:--"No, I want none." You will press
1127: me, and I will softly push my plate over to you and you will fill it
1128: with _ghi_, and I shall dip my cake in it with delight. Believe me,
1129: Mother, this homecoming will take place just as I have described it. I
1130: see you before me always. It seems to me only yesterday that I bent to
1131: your feet when I made salutation and you put your hand upon my head.
1132: 
1133: Mother, put your trust in God to guard my head. If my grave lies in
1134: France it can never be in the Punjab, though we try for a thousand
1135: years. If it be in the Punjab then I shall certainly return to it to
1136: that very place. Meantime, Mother, consider what I have to eat. This is
1137: the true list. I eat daily sugar and ghi and flour, salt, meat, red
1138: peppers, some almonds and dates, sweets of various kinds as well as
1139: raisins and cardamoms. In the morning I eat tea and white biscuits. An
1140: hour after, halwa and puri [native dishes]. At noon, tea and bread; at
1141: seven o'clock of the evening, vegetable curry. At bedtime I drink milk.
1142: There is abundance of milk in this country. I am more comfortable here,
1143: I swear it to you, Mother, than any high officer in India. As for our
1144: clothing, there is no account kept of it. You would cry out, Mother, to
1145: see the thick cloth expended. So I beg you, Mother, to take comfort
1146: concerning your son. Do not tear my heart by telling me your years.
1147: Though we both lived to be as old as elephants I am your son who will
1148: come asking for you as I said, at your door.
1149: 
1150: As to the risk of death, who is free from it anywhere? Certainly not in
1151: the Punjab. I hear that all those religious mendicants at Zilabad have
1152: proclaimed a holy fair this summer in order that pious people may feed
1153: them, and now, having collected in thousands beside the river in hot
1154: weather, they have spread cholera all over the district. There is
1155: trouble raging throughout all the world, Mother, and yet these sons of
1156: mean fathers must proclaim a beggars' festival in order to add to it!
1157: There should be an order of the Government to take all those lazy
1158: rascals out of India into France and put them in our front-line that
1159: their bodies may be sieves for the machine guns. Why cannot they

1160: blacken their faces and lie in a corner with a crust of bread? It is
1161: certainly right to feed the family priests, Mother, but when the idle
1162: assemble in thousands begging and making sickness and polluting the
1163: drinking-water, punishment should be administered.
1164: 
1165: Very much sickness, such as cholera and dysentery, is caused by
1166: drinking foul water. Therefore, it is best to have it boiled, Mother,
1167: no matter what is said. When clothes are washed in foul water, sickness
1168: also spreads. You will say, Mother, that I am no longer a trooper but a
1169: washer-woman or an apothecary, but I swear to you, my Mother, what I
1170: have said is true. Now, I have two charges to deliver to you as to the
1171: household under you. I beg you, my Mother, to give order that my son
1172: drink water which is boiled, at least from the beginning of the hot
1173: weather till after the Rains. That is one charge. The second is that
1174: when I was going down to the sea with the Regiment from home, the Lady
1175: Doctor Sahiba in the Civil Lines asked of our Colonel's lady whether
1176: any of us desired that their households should take the charm against
1177: the small-pox [be vaccinated]. I was then busy with my work and I made
1178: no reply. Now let that Doctor Sahiba know that I desire by her favour
1179: that my son take the charm as soon as may be. I charge you, Mother,
1180: upon _his_ head that it is done soon. I beg you respectfully to take
1181: this charge upon you.
1182: 
1183: Oh, my Mother, if I could now see you for but half of one watch in the
1184: night or at evening preparing food! I remember the old days in my
1185: dreamings but when I awake--there is the sleeper and there is the
1186: bedding and it is more far off than Delhi. But God will accomplish the
1187: meetings and surely arrange the return.
1188: 
1189: Mother, before going out to the attack the other day, I had a dream. I
1190: dreamed that a great snake appeared in our trenches in France and at
1191: the same time our Pir Murshid [our family priest] whose face I saw
1192: quite clearly, appeared with a stick and destroyed it. Well then,
1193: Mother, our lot went in to the attack and returned from it safely.
1194: Those who were fated to be the victims of death were taken and those
1195: who were fated to be wounded were wounded; and all our party returned
1196: safely. At the same time, the Government secured a victory and the
1197: Regiment obtained renown. It was _our_ horse that went out over the
1198: trenches, Mother, and the Germans, being alarmed, fled. We were
1199: forbidden to pursue because of hidden guns. This was trouble to us. We
1200: owed them much blood on our brethren's account. Tell the Murshid my
1201: dream and ask him for a full interpretation. I have also seen our
1202: Murshid twice before in my dreams. Ask him why he comes to me thus. I
1203: am not conscious of any wrong-doing, and if it is a sign of favour to
1204: me, then the shape should speak.
1205: 
1206: I am quite aware how God rewards the unwilling. He is all powerful.
1207: Look at the case of that man of our own family who was ordered to the
1208: front with a higher rank. He refused promotion in order to stay behind,
1209: and in a month's time he died of the plague in his own village. If he
1210: had gone to the front his family would have received the war pension.
1211: An atheist never achieves honour, Mother. He is always unsettled and
1212: has no consolations. Do we Mussulmans think that the Prophet will spend
1213: all his time in asking God to forgive our transgressions? Tell the Pir
1214: Murshid what I have written.
1215: 
1216: Mother, put down your ear and listen to me in this matter, my Mother.
1217: There is one thing I wish to impress earnestly on you. You must know
1218: that among recruits for the Regiment there are too few of our kind of
1219: Mussulmans. They are sending recruits from the Punjab who were formerly
1220: labourers and common workmen. The consequence of this is, in the

1221: Regiment, that we Mussulmans are completely outnumbered by these low
1222: people, and the promotions go accordingly. Each of our troops, my
1223: Mother, has been divided into two; that is to say there are four troops
1224: to a squadron. We Mussulmans should have at least two troops out of the
1225: four, but owing to the lack of recruits we have not sufficient men of
1226: our faith to form more than one. Now, Mother, as it was in our fathers'
1227: time, he who supplies the men gets the promotion. Therefore, if our
1228: friends at home, and especially our Pir Murshid, would exert themselves
1229: to supply fifteen or twenty recruits, I could approach my Colonel Sahib
1230: in regard to promotion. If my Colonel received my request favourably
1231: then you at home would only have the trouble to provide the men. But I
1232: do not think, Mother, there would be any trouble if our Pir Murshid
1233: exerted himself in the matter and if my father's brother also exerted
1234: himself. A family is a family even [if it be] scattered to the ends of
1235: the earth, Mother. My father's brother's name is still remembered in
1236: the Regiment on account of his long service and his great deeds of old.
1237: Tell him, my Mother, that the men talk of him daily as though he had
1238: only resigned yesterday. If he rides out among the villages with his
1239: medals he will certainly fetch in many of our class. If it were fifty
1240: it would mean much more influence for me with my Colonel. He is very
1241: greedy for our class of Mahommedans.
1242: 
1243: Mother, our Pir Murshid too, is a very holy man. If he preached to them
1244: after harvest he would fetch in many and I should be promoted, and the
1245: pensions go with the promotion. In a short time by God's assistance, I
1246: might command a troop if sufficient recruits were attained by the
1247: exertions of my friends and well-wishers. The honour of one is the
1248: honour of all. Lay all this before the Murshid and my uncle.
1249: 
1250: None of the Cavalry have yet done anything to compare with our
1251: Regiment. This may be because of fate or that their nature is not equal
1252: to ours. There is great honour to be got out of a lance before long.
1253: The war has become loosened and cavalry patrols are being sent forward.
1254: We have driven Mama Lumra [a nickname for the enemy] several miles
1255: across country. He has planted his feet again but it is not the same
1256: Mama Lumra. His arrogance is gone. Our guns turn the earth upside down
1257: upon him. He has made himself houses underground which are in all
1258: respects fortresses with beds, chairs and lights. Our guns break these
1259: in. There is little to see because Mama Lumra is buried underneath.
1260: These days are altogether different from the days when all our Army was
1261: here and Mama Lumra's guns overwhelmed us by day and by night. Now Mama
1262: Lumra eats his own stick. Fighting goes on in the sky, on earth and
1263: under earth. Such a fighting is rarely vouchsafed any one to behold.
1264: Yet if one reflects upon God it is no more than rain on a roof. Mother,
1265: once I was reported "missing, killed or believed taken prisoner." I
1266: went with a patrol to a certain place beyond which we went forward to a
1267: place which had recently been taken by the English infantry. Suddenly
1268: the enemy's fire fell upon us and behind us like water. Seeing we could
1269: not go back, we lay down in the holes made by the shells. The enemy
1270: exerted himself to the utmost, but our guns having found him bombarded
1271: him and he ceased. In the evening we retired out of our shell-holes. We
1272: had to walk; it was fasting time and we suffered from thirst. So our
1273: hearts were relieved when we returned to the Regiment. We had all been
1274: reported to Divisional Headquarters as lost. This false report was then
1275: cancelled. The shell-holes in the ground are the size of our goat-pen
1276: and as deep as my height with the arm raised. They are more in number
1277: than can be counted, and of all colours. It is like small-pox upon the
1278: ground.
1279: 
1280: We have no small-pox or diseases here. Our doctors are strict, and
1281: refuse is burned by the sweepers. It is said there is no physician like
1282: fire. He leaves nothing to the flies. It is said that flies produce
1283: sicknesses, especially when they are allowed to sit on the nostrils and
1284: the corners of the eyes of the children or to fall into their
1285: milk-pots. The young children of this country of France are beautiful
1286: and do not suffer from sickness. Their women do not die in childbed.
1287: This is on account of physicians and midwives who abound in knowledge.
1288: It is a Government order, Mother, that none can establish as a midwife
1289: till she has shown her ability. These people are idolators. When there
1290: is a death which is not caused by war, they instantly ascribe it to
1291: some fault in eating or drinking or the conduct of life on the part of
1292: the dead. If one dies without manifest cause the physicians at once
1293: mutilate the body to ascertain what evil was hidden inside it. If
1294: anything is discovered there is a criminal trial. Thus the women-folk
1295: do not traffic in poisons and wives have no suspicion one against the
1296: other. Truly, Mother, people are only defective on account of
1297: ignorance. Learning and knowledge are the important things.
1298: 
1299: Your letters come to me with every mail exactly as if we were at

1300: headquarters. This is accomplished solely by knowledge. There are
1301: hundreds of women behind our lines who make clean and repair the dirty
1302: clothes of the troops. Afterwards, they are baked in very hot ovens
1303: which utterly destroy the vermin and also, it is said, diseases. We
1304: have, too, been issued iron helmets to protect the head against falling
1305: shots. It was asked of us all if any had an objection. The Sikhs

1306: reported that they had not found any permission in their Law to wear
1307: such things. They, therefore, go uncovered. It was reported by our
1308: priests for us Mahommedans that our Law neither forbids nor enjoins. It
1309: is a thing indifferent. They are heavier than the pagri [turban], but
1310: they turn falling iron. Doubtless, it is Allah's will that the lives of
1311: His Faithful should be prolonged by these hats. The sons of mothers who
1312: go to foreign parts are specially kept under His Eye.
1313: 
1314: We know very well how the world is made. To earn a living and bear
1315: trouble is the duty of man. If I send you a report that I have won
1316: promotion in the Regiment, do not forget to distribute alms to the
1317: extent of fifteen rupees and to feed the poor.
1318: 
1319: Mother, put down your ear and listen to me. There is no danger whatever
1320: in box-pictures [snapshot-photographs]. Anyone submitted to them is in
1321: all respects as he was before. Nothing is taken out of his spirit. I,
1322: myself, Mother, have submitted myself to many box-pictures, both

1323: mounted and standing beside my horse. If at any time again the Zenana
1324: Doctor Sahiba desires to make a box-picture of _him_ do not snatch the
1325: child away but send the picture to me. I cannot see him in my dreams
1326: because at his age he changes with each month. When I went away he was
1327: still on all fours. Now you tell me he stands up holding by the skirts.
1328: I wish to see a box-picture of this very greatly indeed. I can read
1329: box-pictures now as perfectly as the French. When I was new to this
1330: country I could not understand their meaning in the least. This is on
1331: account of knowledge which comes by foreign travel and experience.
1332: Mother, this world abounds in marvels beyond belief. We in India are
1333: but stones compared to these people. They do not litigate among
1334: themselves; they speak truth at first answer; their weddings are not
1335: [performed] till both sides are at least eighteen, and no man has
1336: authority here to beat his wife.
1337: 
1338: I have resided in billets with an old man and his wife, who possess
1339: seven hens, an ass, and a small field of onions. They collect dung from
1340: our horse-lines upon their backs, a very little at a time but
1341: continuously. They are without means of maintenance, yet they do not
1342: lay a finger upon any food except through invitation. They exhibit
1343: courtesy to each other in all things.
1344: 
1345: They call me _Sia_ [monsieur?] which is Mian [Mahommedan title of
1346: respect] and also _man barah_ [mon brave?] which signifies hero. I have
1347: spoken to them many times of you, my Mother, and they desire I send you
1348: their salutations. She calls me to account strictly for my doings each
1349: day. At evening tide I am fetched in with the hens. My clothes are then
1350: inspected and repaired when there is need. She turns me back and forth
1351: between her hands. If I exhibit impatience, she hits me upon the side
1352: of the head, and I say to my heart it is your hands.
1353: 
1354: Now this is the French language, Mother.
1355: 
1356: (1) _Zuur mononfahn._ The morning salutation.
1357: 
1358: (2) _Wasi lakafeh._ Coffee is prepared.
1359: 
1360: (3) _Abil towah mononfahn._ Rise and go to parade.
1361: 
1362: (4) _Dormeh beeahn mon fiz nublieh pahleh Bondihu._ This is their
1363: dismissal at night, invoking the blessing of their God. They use a
1364: _Tasbih_ [rosary] in form like ours but of more beads. They recite
1365: prayers both sitting and walking. Having seen my _Tasbih_ these old
1366: people become curious concerning the Faith. Certainly they are
1367: idolators. I have seen the images by the roadside which they worship.
1368: Yet they are certainly not Kafirs, who hide the truth and the mercy of
1369: Allah is illimitable. They two send you their salutations thus:--_Onvoyeh
1370: no zalutazioun zempresseh ar zmadam vot mair._ It is their form of
1371: blessing.
1372: 
1373: She has borne three sons. Two are already dead in this war and of the
1374: third no information since the spring-time. There remains in the house
1375: the son of the eldest son. He is three years old. His name is Pir,
1376: which in their language also means a holy man. He runs barefoot in
1377: summer and wears only one garment. He eats all foods and specially
1378: dates. In this country it is not allowed to give children pepper or
1379: cardamoms. He has learned to speak our tongue and bears a wooden sword
1380: which was made for him and a turban of our sort. When he is weary he
1381: repairs to the centre of my bed which is forbidden to him by his

1382: grandmother of whom he has no fear. He fears nothing. My Mother, he is
1383: almost the same sort as my own. He sends his salutations to him. He
1384: calls him "My brother who is in India." He also prays for him aloud
1385: before an idol which he is taken to worship. On account of his fatness
1386: he cannot yet kneel long, but falls over sideways. The idol is of
1387: Bibbee Miriam [the Virgin Mary] whom they, in this country, believe to
1388: watch over children. He has also a small idol of his own above his bed
1389: which represents a certain saint called Pir. He rides upon the ass and
1390: says he will become a trooper. I take delight in his presence and his
1391: conversation.
1392: 
1393: The children in this country are learned from their very birth. They go
1394: to the schools even when the shells fall near by. They know all the
1395: countries in the world, and to read and write in their language and to
1396: cast accounts. Even the girls of eight years can cast accounts and
1397: those that are marriageable have complete knowledge of cookery,
1398: accounts, and governments, and washing of clothes, agriculture and the
1399: manufacture of garments and all other offices: otherwise they are
1400: reckoned infirm-minded. Each girl is given a dowry to which she adds
1401: with her own hands. No man molests any woman here on any occasion. They
1402: come and go at their pleasure upon their business. There is one thing I
1403: should like to see, Mother. I should like to see all the men of India
1404: with all their wives brought to France in order to see the country and
1405: profit by their experiences. Here are no quarrels or contentions, and
1406: there is no dishonesty. All day long men do their work and the women do
1407: theirs. Compared with these people the people of India do not work at
1408: all, but all day long are occupied with evil thoughts and our women all
1409: day long they do nothing but quarrel. Now I see this. The blame for
1410: this state of affairs, Mother, lies upon the men of India, for if the
1411: men were to educate the women they would give up quarrelling.
1412: 
1413: When a man goes out into the world his understanding is enlarged and he
1414: becomes proficient in different kinds of work. All that is needed is to
1415: show courage. At the present time, one's bravery or one's cowardice is
1416: apparent. The opportunities for advancement come quickly. Such
1417: opportunities will not occur again.
1418: 
1419: As for any marriage proposed [for me?] when I return, those things can
1420: wait till I return. It is no gain to take into the house a child or a
1421: sickly one who, through no fault of her own, dies in bringing forth. If
1422: there be any talk between our house and any other family upon this
1423: subject they should understand that I desire knowledge more than dowry.
1424: There are schools where girls are educated by English ladies. I am not
1425: of the sort to make a wedding outside my clan or country, but if I
1426: fight to keep Mama Lumra out of the Punjab I will choose my wives out
1427: of the Punjab. I desire nothing that is contrary to the Faith, Mother,
1428: but what was ample yesterday does not cover even the palm of the hand
1429: to-day. This is owing to the spread of enlightenment among all men
1430: coming and going and observing matters which they had never before
1431: known to exist.
1432: 
1433: In this country when one of them dies, the tomb is marked and named and
1434: kept like a garden so that the others may go to mourn over her. Nor do
1435: they believe a burial-ground to be inhabited by evil spirits or ghouls.
1436: When I was upon a certain duty last month, I lay three nights in a
1437: grave-yard. None troubled me, even though the dead had been removed
1438: from their graves by the violence of shells bursting. One was a woman
1439: of this country, newly dead, whom we reburied for the sake of the Pity
1440: of Allah, and made the prayer. Tell the Pir Murshid this, and that I
1441: performed _Tayamummum_ [the shorter purification with sand or dust]
1442: afterwards. There was no time for the full purification.
1443: 
1444: Oh, my Mother, my Mother, I am your son, your son; and as I have said
1445: at the beginning I will return to your arms from out of this country,
1446: when God shall permit!
1447:
