Program flow API:
	label c 
		This command labels the current location in the function’s code.  
		Only labeledlocations can be jumped to from other parts of the program.  
		The label c is anarbitrary  string  composed  of  letters,  numbers,  and  the  special  characters  “_”,“:”, and “.”.  
		The scope of the label is the current function. 

	goto c 
		This  command  effects  a  "goto"  operation,  causing  execution  to  continue  from
		the location marked by the c label.
		The jump destination must be located in the same function. 
		
	if-goto c 
		This  command  effects  a  "conditional  goto"  operation.    
		The  stack’s  topmost  value is popped; if the value is not zero,
		execution continues from the location marked by the c label;
		otherwise, execution continues from the next command in the program. 
		The jump destination must be located in the same function.

Functions:

	call functionName nArgs - pseudocode - Unit 8.6 min 13:30
	
	function functionName nVars - pseudocode - Unit 8.6 min 15:45

	return - pseudocode - Unit 8.6 min 21:25

	Sys.vm file - Unit 8.9 min 17:25
	
	bootstrap code - SP=256
					 call Sys.init
	
	Sys.init calls main function of the file Main.vm and enters the infinite loop

Existing files modifications:
	Unit 8.8 - 	
					Main - process either directory containing .vm files resulting in dir.asm file or
							single file.vm resulting in file.asm
							
					Parser - add new functions (done)
					Writer - writeInit - Bootstrap code and recheck setFileName functionality
