===========================================================================================
This exercise is about working with recursion.
It includes one file:
    1. ex6.py - 10 functions about recursion using

==================
=  Description:  =
==================
Running the program 'ex6.py' will provide access to 10 recursive functions:
1) print_to_n(n) - printing integer numbers from 1 to n
2) print_reversed(n) - printing integer numbers from n to 1
3) is_prime(n) - fixing (boolean) if the number n is prime or not
4) divisors(n) - creating the list of divisors of n
5) exp_n_x(n, x) - counting the exponent value by degree n of number x
6) play_hanoi(hanoi, n, src, dest, tmp) - realisation of hanoi game from hanoi_game.py
7) print_binary_sequences(n) - printing all possible sequences by length n of 0 and 1
8) print_sequences(char_list, n) - printing all possible sequences by length n of
characters from char_list
9) print_no_repetition_sequences(char_list, n) - printing all possible sequences
by length n of characters from char_list without repetitions
10) no_repetition_sequences_list(char_list, n) - creating list of strings that are all
possible sequences by length n of characters from char_list without repetitions
