==================
Running the program 'hangman.py' will start the game process i.e. open the interface of the game,
close interface window to exit.
    Functions:
    run_single_game(words_list) - activates the game (loop for one game) in addition to the word_lists that was passed,
            choosing randomally the word from the list and starting the game with this word as clue.
            The function will stop if the user guesses the word or if the user makes maximal quantity of errors.
    main() - calls to function run_single_game and continues until user will not push 'No More!'.
