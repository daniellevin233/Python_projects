I discussed the exercise with: Peleg Labsupport

==========================================================
=  README for ex2: Functions, string parsing, user input =
==========================================================
This exercise is about writing parameterized functions, string parsing and user input.
It includes 6 files -
    1.convert_spoon_to_cup.py - converting the liquid in spoons to the liquid in cups
    2.calculate_mathematical_expression.py - calculating mathematical operation from the user
    3.largest_and_smallest.py - finding the biggest and the smallest numbers out of 2 given numbers
    4.quadratic_equations.py - finding the roots of quadratic equations with the parameters from the user
    5.shapes.py - counting the area of shapes with parameters from the user
    6.temperature.py - checking if it is summer for Agrid, or not yet

==================
=  Description:  =
==================
running the program 'convert_spoon_to_cup.py' will provide the access to the certain function
running the program 'calculate_mathematical_expression.py' will provide the access to the certain function
running the program 'largest_and_smallest.py' will provide the access to the certain function
running the program 'quadratic_equations.py' will run the function which will ask for the input
running the program 'shapes.py' will run the function which will ask for the input
running the program 'temperature.py' will provide the access for the certain function
