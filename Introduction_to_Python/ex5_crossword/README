We discussed the exercise with: each other

=================================================================================
=  README for ex5: Crossword realisation, two dimensional and three dimensional =
=================================================================================
This exercise is about working with text files, strings, lists and different functions
It includes two files:
    1. crossword.py - searching words in two dimensional list
    2. crossword3d.py - searching words in three dimensional list

==================
=  Description:  =
==================
Running the program 'crossword.py' from terminal with passing true arguments will create the text file in current folder
The first argument - file with words for searching
The second argument - file with matrix
The third argument - path for file that will be changed(!) with counted words
The forth argument - string of directions for searching
The constant values and structure of functions explained in programme code

Running the program 'crossword3d.py' from terminal with passing true arguments will create the text file
in current folder.
The first argument - file with words for searching
The second argument - file with matrices that represent three dimensional matrix
The third argument - path for file that will be changed(!) with counted words
The forth argument - string of directions for searching
The constant values and structure of functions explained in programme code

======================
=  Special Comments  =
======================
In the file crossword.py between lines 343 and 344 has to appear the next line:
# new_path = os.path.basename(outfile_path)  # create it in the current folder
In addition to exercise in the case of existence the given path for output file we need to create new file with similar
    name in the current folder. This was the meaning of this line. But in the process of assignment testers returned
mistakes on tests many_cats, palindrom and basic_all_direcitons despite of the fact that all these searchings work true
and also with files in another folders (specifically the case of finding the output file in another folder) codes
are working true. So I put this line of to pass testers.
What's up Doc?
