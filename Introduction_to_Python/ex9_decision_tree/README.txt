I discussed the exercise with: HAGAI LABSUPPORT

==============================================================================
=  README for ex9: Realisation of building binary decision trees for searching
=  diagnoses of the illnesses.
=  Beside that realisation of 4 classes:
=  Node - representing nodes of the tree
=  Record - representing illness and symptoms list from text files
=  Diagnoser - representing class for treatment each tree.
=  Realisation of different functions for working with trees inside of
=  Diagnoser class
==============================================================================

It includes one files:
    1. ex9.py - classes and functions for trees building
Function optimal tree builds different possible binary trees and chooses
the optimal of them for minimal error rate.
Function build_tree builds the binary decision tree with given parameters
==================
=  Description:  =
==================

Running the program 'ex9.py' will provide the access to building binary
decision trees out of data from text files,
and for each tree you have different treatment
methods for working with decision tree and getting different diagnoses,
error rates etc.
